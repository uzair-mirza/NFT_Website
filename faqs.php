                    Non-Fungible Tokens, or NFT for short, have become one of the most popular digital commodities today. NFTs are one-of-a-kind and cannot be substituted. NFTs have a unique signature that is used to identify and authenticate their ownership as assets. There can't be a duplicate of it. NFTs are usually depictions and impressions of real-world items, persons, art, and so on. They're considered in-game objects, collectibles, artworks, digital assets, and so on. </p>
